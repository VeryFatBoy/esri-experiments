## [around-the-world](https://jwasilgeo.github.io/esri-experiments/around-the-world)

Find out what lies across the ocean and beyond by traveling around the Earth, and along the way learn how geodesic lines appear on globes vs. 2D web mercator maps.

## [earth-at-night](https://jwasilgeo.github.io/esri-experiments/earth-at-night)

Explore the Earth at night as seen by Suomi NPP VIIRS. Light emissions are used as the world's thematic elevation layer by using [chroma.js](https://gka.github.io/chroma.js/) to calculate pixel color luminance.
